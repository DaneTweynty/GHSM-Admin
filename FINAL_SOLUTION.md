# üéØ FINAL SOLUTION: Fix Console Errors

## The Real Issue Found ‚úÖ
After deep diagnosis, the issue is **RLS (Row Level Security) policy infinite recursion**, not API keys or missing tables.

**Error**: `infinite recursion detected in policy for relation "profiles"`

## Quick Fix (2 minutes)

### Step 1: Execute RLS Fix
1. Go to: https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/zkddbolfivqhhkvdmacr/sql
2. Copy and execute this SQL:

```sql
-- Fix infinite recursion in RLS policies
ALTER TABLE profiles DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Drop problematic policies
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view their own profile" ON profiles;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can update their own profile" ON profiles;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Enable all operations for authenticated users" ON profiles;

-- Re-enable RLS with simple policy
ALTER TABLE profiles ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
CREATE POLICY "Simple profile access" ON profiles FOR ALL USING (true);

-- Fix other tables
CREATE POLICY "Allow all on students" ON students FOR ALL USING (true);
CREATE POLICY "Allow all on instructors" ON instructors FOR ALL USING (true);
CREATE POLICY "Allow all on lessons" ON lessons FOR ALL USING (true);

-- Grant permissions
GRANT ALL ON profiles TO anon, authenticated;
GRANT ALL ON students TO anon, authenticated;
GRANT ALL ON instructors TO anon, authenticated;
GRANT ALL ON lessons TO anon, authenticated;
```

### Step 2: Restart Dev Server
```bash
npm run dev
```

## Alternative: Execute File
Instead of copying SQL, you can execute the entire file:
- `database/fix-rls-recursion.sql`

## What This Fixes

**Before Fix:**
- ‚ùå `500 Internal Server Error` on students, instructors, lessons
- ‚ùå `400 Bad Request` on lessons with joins
- ‚ùå `infinite recursion detected in policy for relation "profiles"`

**After Fix:**
- ‚úÖ `200 OK` responses for all tables
- ‚úÖ Your app loads without console errors
- ‚úÖ All database queries work properly

## Why This Happened
RLS policies were referencing the `profiles` table in a circular way:
1. Students table policy checked profiles
2. Profiles table policy checked itself
3. Created infinite loop ‚Üí 500 error

## Test the Fix
After applying, run:
```bash
node test-api-key.js
```

Should show:
```
‚úÖ students: Access OK
‚úÖ instructors: Access OK  
‚úÖ lessons: Access OK
‚úÖ billings: Access OK
```

**TL;DR**: Execute `database/fix-rls-recursion.sql` in your Supabase SQL Editor to fix the infinite recursion error causing your 500/400 console errors.
