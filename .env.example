# Security Note:
# The service role key is intentionally excluded from this example as it:
# - Bypasses Row Level Security (RLS)
# - Should never be used in client-side code
# - Would be a serious security vulnerability if exposed in a frontend application
# 3. Never commit .env.local to version control
# 4. Add .env.local to your .gitignore file if not already present
